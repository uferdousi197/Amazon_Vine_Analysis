# Amazon_Vine_Analysis


# Overview of the analysis

For this project I have selected a set of data from Amazon Ebook reviews. To extract the dataset, I used Pyspark and I also connected it to an AWS RDS. I transformed the data using pgAdmin.

Results
How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there in the dataset?
There were a total of 65,149 non-Vine reviews. There were no Vine views.



How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
There was a total of 24,673 5-star non-Vine reviews.



What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
The percentage of non-Vine reviews is almost 38%.



# Summary
I cannot conclude whether there are any bias for the reviews in the Vine Program from this dataset as there weren't any Vine reviews. For future analysis, I will need data from Vine reviwers so that I can accurately find the metric on percentage of 5 star reviews.
